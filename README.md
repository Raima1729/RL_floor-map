# RL_floor-map

Using Q-Learning algorithm of RL, a simple technique was made to enable an autonomous robot start from it's own position, find the shortest path and avoid obstacles (walls) to reach it's destination. The outputs of the Q-Learning algorithm were saved in a .txt file. This .txt file was later used as an input for the animation of the actual 3x3 map.
